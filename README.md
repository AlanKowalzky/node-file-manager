# 🗂️ File Manager

A command-line based File Manager built with Node.js.  
Supports file operations, navigation, system information retrieval, hashing, compression, and more – all using asynchronous APIs and ESM modules.

---

## ✅ Features

### 📁 File & Directory Operations
- Navigate up and down the directory tree
- List files and folders in the current directory
- Create, rename, copy, move, and delete files and folders
- Read file content in the console

### ⚙️ System Information
- Get EOL character
- Show CPU information (count, model, speed)
- Display home directory
- Show system username
- Get CPU architecture

### 🔐 Security
- Calculate SHA-256 hash of files

### 🗜️ Compression
- Compress files using Brotli algorithm
- Decompress Brotli-compressed files

---

## 🧱 Technical Stack

- **Node.js**
- **ESM modules** (no CommonJS)
- **Streams API** (no synchronous file access)
- Modular architecture (at least 7 separate modules)
